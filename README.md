# VTSSC
VTSSC stands for Virginia Tech Student Study Connect which was my final project for my Web-Based DSS (BIT 4444) at Virginia Tech. This was my first project utilizing web-development languages/technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL, JQuery, and D3.js. The goal of this project was to create a web-application that connects students needing help in their coursework to other students who are able to help out. To do this, we created an application that allowed students to create profiles, upload and view study notes, and schedule appointments with other students.
